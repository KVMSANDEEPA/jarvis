# Jarvis Project

Welcome to the Jarvis Project! This README provides an overview of the project and instructions to set it up.

## Project Description

Jarvis is a personal assistant web application. It is designed to help users manage tasks, set reminders, and organize their daily activities efficiently.

## Python Backend Setup

Follow these steps to set up the Python backend for the Jarvis Project:

1. **Install Python (if not installed)**:
    - Download Python 3.11+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
    - During installation, check "Add Python to PATH".
    - Verify installation:
      ```bash
      python --version
      pip --version
      ```

2. **Install pip packages**:
    - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
    - Navigate to your project folder:
      ```bash
      cd C:\xampp\htdocs\jarvis-assistant
      ```
    - Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
      This will install:
      - Flask â†’ Web server
      - pyttsx3 â†’ Text-to-speech
      - SpeechRecognition â†’ Voice input
      - pyaudio â†’ Microphone support
      - pyautogui â†’ PC automation (e.g., screenshots, open apps)
      - google-generativeai â†’ Gemini AI

    - **Important**: If `pyaudio` fails to install on Windows, install the wheel manually:
      1. Go to [this site](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio).
      2. Download the matching `.whl` for your Python version.
      3. Install via:
         ```bash
         pip install C:\path\to\PyAudioâ€‘0.2.14â€‘cp311â€‘cp311â€‘win_amd64.whl
         ```

3. **Set Gemini API Key**:
    - Open `config.py` and replace:
      ```python
      GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
      ```
    - Sign up for Gemini AI and get a free API key: [Gemini AI](https://developers.google.com/).

4. **Create folders (if not present)**:
    - Ensure the following folders exist:
      ```bash
      mkdir data
      mkdir data/screenshots
      ```
    - SQLite database (`jarvis.db`) will be created automatically.

5. **Run the project**:
    - Run your Flask server:
      ```bash
      python main.py
      ```
    - You should see something like:
      ```
      * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
      ```

6. **Access the Application**:
    - Open your browser and go to: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

7. **Test Functionality**:
    - Type a command in the input box.
    - Press "Send" or "Enter".
    - Click ðŸŽ¤ to speak commands.
    - Use shortcut buttons like "Open Notepad" or "Screenshot".
